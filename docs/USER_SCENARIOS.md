→ Product DB lookup (0.5s) → Inventory check (1s) → 
   Spec formatting (0.5s) → Price calculation (0.5s) = 2.5s

Query: "iPhone 15 features and stock status"
→ Product DB lookup (0.5s) → Inventory check (1s) → 
   Spec formatting (0.5s) → Price calculation (0.5s) = 2.5s
```
**Problem**: Redundant DB queries for semantically identical requests

#### With Mentis + Smart Invalidation
```
Query: "Show me iPhone 15 specs and availability"
→ Full lookup pipeline = 2.5s
[Caches with provenance: source_url="inventory-api/iphone15", last_modified="2025-07-08T10:00:00Z"]

Query: "iPhone 15 features and stock status" (5 minutes later)
→ Semantic lookup (0.1s) → Cache hit (similarity: 0.89) = 0.1s

Inventory Update Event:
→ Mentis detects inventory-api change → Marks iPhone 15 artifacts as STALE

Query: "iPhone 15 availability" (after update)
→ Semantic lookup finds STALE data → Triggers refresh → Fresh data (2.5s)
```

#### API Integration
```bash
# Product lookup with caching
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/cache/publish \
  -d '{
    "objects": [{

2. Download PDF (2s) 
3. Extract text from PDF (5s)
4. Generate embeddings (4s)
5. Identify key concepts (10s)
6. Extract citations (3s)
7. Summarize findings (15s)
Total per paper: 42s × 50 papers = 35 minutes
```

#### Multi-Agent Collaboration Problem
```
Agent A: Processes "Quantum Neural Networks" papers
Agent B: Processes "Machine Learning on Quantum Computers" papers  
Agent C: Processes "Quantum-Classical Hybrid Learning" papers

Overlap: 60% of papers appear in multiple searches
Result: 60% redundant processing across agents
```

#### With Mentis: Intelligent Reuse
```
Agent A: "Quantum Neural Networks" research
→ Processes 20 papers, caches all workflow steps
[Artifacts: RAW(PDFs), DERIVED(text), DERIVED(embeddings), REASONING(concepts), ANSWER(summaries)]

Agent B: "Machine Learning on Quantum Computers" 
→ Semantic lookup finds 12 cached papers (similarity > 0.85)
→ Processes only 8 new papers
→ Combines cached insights with new findings

Agent C: "Quantum-Classical Hybrid Learning"
→ Semantic lookup finds 15 cached papers  
→ Processes only 5 new papers
→ Builds comprehensive analysis from cached components
```

#### Workflow Optimization
```bash
# Agent A - First research session
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/workflow/sessions \
  -d '{
    "goal": "Analyze quantum neural networks research",
    "context": {"domain": "quantum_ml", "timeframe": "2023-2024"}
  }'

# Agent A processes papers and caches steps

  -d '{
    "session_id": "research-001",
    "step_type": "extract_concepts", 
    "input": "quantum neural network paper content...",
    "metadata": {"paper_id": "arxiv:2024.1234", "authors": "Smith et al."}
  }'

# Agent B finds related work
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/workflow/steps/lookup \
  -d '{
    "session_id": "research-002",
    "step_type": "extract_concepts",
    "input": "machine learning quantum computers...",
    "top_k": 10
  }'
```

#### Advanced Cache Reuse
```

Without Mentis:
Paper 1: [Download] → [Extract] → [Embed] → [Analyze] → [Summarize] = 42s
Paper 2: [Download] → [Extract] → [Embed] → [Analyze] → [Summarize] = 42s
Paper 3: [Download] → [Extract] → [Embed] → [Analyze] → [Summarize] = 42s
...
Total: 42s × 50 papers = 35 minutes

With Mentis (Multi-Agent):
Agent A - Papers 1-20: 42s × 20 = 14 minutes (cold cache)
Agent B - Papers 15-35: 
  - 12 cache hits: 0.1s × 12 = 1.2s
  - 8 new papers: 42s × 8 = 5.6 minutes  
  - Total: 6.8 minutes
Agent C - Papers 25-50:
  - 15 cache hits: 0.1s × 15 = 1.5s
  - 10 new papers: 42s × 10 = 7 minutes
  - Total: 8.5 minutes

Combined: 14 + 6.8 + 8.5 = 29.3 minutes (vs 105 minutes without sharing)
```

              └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘
```

#### Complex Multi-Agent Workflow
```
Trading Decision Pipeline (Every 100ms):

1. Market Data Agent:
   - Ingests 50+ data feeds (10ms)
   - Normalizes price data (5ms)
   - Calculates technical indicators (15ms)
   
2. Signal Generation Agent:
   - Processes normalized data (20ms)
   - Applies ML models (30ms)
   - Generates trading signals (10ms)
   
3. Risk Management Agent:
   - Evaluates position limits (8ms)
   - Calculates VaR (15ms)  
   - Stress test scenarios (12ms)
   
4. Portfolio Agent:
   - Optimizes position sizing (25ms)
   - Rebalancing calculations (20ms)
   - Correlation analysis (15ms)
   
5. Execution Agent:
   - Order routing decisions (5ms)
   - Market impact modeling (10ms)
   - Trade execution (variable)

Total: ~200ms per complete cycle
```

#### The Coordination Challenge
```
Problem: Agent Redundancy and Conflicts

Market Data Processing:
→ Signal Agent processes S&P 500 data
→ Risk Agent re-processes same S&P 500 data  
→ Portfolio Agent re-processes same data again
→ 3x redundant computation for identical inputs

Signal Generation Conflicts:
→ Agent A: Buy AAPL (momentum signal)
→ Agent B: Sell AAPL (mean reversion signal)
→ Agent C: Hold AAPL (fundamental signal)
→ No coordination mechanism to resolve conflicts

Risk Calculation Duplication:
→ Each agent calculates portfolio risk independently
→ Inconsistent risk models across agents
→ Delayed risk updates during market volatility
```
